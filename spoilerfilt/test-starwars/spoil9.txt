The Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the Bad Batch fight off several D-wing air support droids while Rex and Tech attempt to free Echo from the tubes connecting him to the stasis chamber. Echo can't remember much since his last mission to the Citadel. Echo's vital life signs are still dependent on the machine and his body is controlled by computer generated brain waves. Since their mission to Skako Minor was unsanctioned, the clones and Skywalker can't call for reinforcements.

Meanwhile, on the ground floor, the D-wing commander informs the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor that the clones are trapped in the Core Systems room. Tambor orders his men to prepare the organic decimator, a large spherical machine capable of vaporizing organic life. Skywalker then contacts Tambor to offer a bargain but the Techno Union leader refuses to relinquish his ownership over Echo. While Anakin watches, Tambor tests the organic decimator on a Poletec captive, killing him instantly. Tambor then issues his ultimatum to the Jedi: surrender or be his next test subject.

Back at the Techno Union facility, Skywalker and the clones are surrounded by countless D-wing droids. Tambor deploys the decimator against the intruders. Meanwhile, Tech manages to figure out how to unplug Echo, who tells them that they can escape through an exhaust pipe above the chamber. After opening the top exhaust door, Wrecker helps lift Skywalker and the clones into the pipe. Before they leave, Wrecker plants several detonators as a "parting gift" for Tambor. Skywalker manages to levitate Wrecker moments before the decimator enters the chamber. After the clones escape, an explosion destroys Tambor's machines and years of research. Furious, the Techno Union leader vows vengeance on Skywalker and the clones.

With Echo leading the way, Skywalker and the clones navigate their way through the facility's cooling systems. Echo informs Rex that the Techno Union had inserted cybernetic implants which gave him access to their database and the building's schematics. When they reach a door, Echo points the way to a narrow long pipe which leads to a landing pad on the other side. While Tech comments about their poor chances of survival, the clones and Skywalker try to cross the pipe but find themselves trapped by D-wing droids on both sides. Seeing several nearby Keeradaks, Wrecker suggests that they mount the winged reptiles in order to escape. Skywalker and the clones leap onto the Keeradaks. The entire party survive the jump but are pursued by the D-wing droids, which can fly. Skywalker and the clones flee on four Keeradaks into the wilderness. Their droid pursuers crash into a cliff face but the clones managed to make it back to the Poletec village they had encountered earlier.
