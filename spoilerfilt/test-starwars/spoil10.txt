The Poletec chief is impressed that the offworlders have managed to tame the Keeradaks but is displeased that they have returned to his village, bringing the war with them. Tech apologizes on behalf of the group for overstaying their welcome. A short time later, several D-wing droids follow but the clones managed to shoot them down. Rex apologizes for breaking their promise and gives a speech denouncing the Techno Union, and shows them the cybernetic prosthetics that the Techno Union have inflicted on Echo. The Poletec are won over by the Clone troopers' arguments. Meanwhile, Tambor sends a force of D-wing droids and octuptarra magna tri-droids to wipe out the clones and the villagers sheltering them.

During the ensuing battle, Skywalker, the clones, and their Poletec allies lure the droid army into a valley and then attack them from all sides. The Poletecs swarm the droids but many are killed by blaster fire. The clones then join the fight while the Octuptarras descend into the valley. The clones also deploy charges that cost the D-wing droids to short circuit. After instructing the clones to take out the Octuptarras, Anakin uses his lightsaber to disable one of the tri-droids. Wrecker throws Rex and another clone onto an Octuptarra each. Rex manages to disable the droid by firing into its eye sensor. Meanwhile, Anakin causes a third Octuptarra to topple into another one; ending the threat of the tri-droids. The surviving D-wings flee back to Wat Tambor, who regards the loss of Echo as a devastating blow to his company's profit margin. He decides to find a way to recoup on the Techno Union's losses.

Back at the village, the Poletec chief praises the bravery and valor of Skywalker and the clone soldiers. Rex also praises Echo for his courageous performance during the battle.
