On a mission to retake the ring space station in Ringo Vinda's orbit, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and twin Jedi Masters Tiplar and Tiplee lead several clone trooper detachments against the occupying droid force under Admiral Trench, among them are Clone Captain Rex, ARC trooper Fives and clone trooper Tup. However, Tup has been lately plagued by strange mental disorders which leave him temporarily confused. When the Jedi and clone forces fight their way into the station's command center, Tup suddenly goes into some form of trance, constantly muttering, "Good soldiers follow orders." Upon seeing Tiplar while in one of those blackouts, Tup unexpectedly sneaks up on her and kills her with a blaster shot to her head. This unexpected attack disrupts the battle's schedule and the composure of the Republic troops, forcing them to retreat.

Tup is checked for medicinal disorders, but strangely no clues to his bizarre condition, which makes him alternate between trances and clear moments where he has no memories of his blackouts, are found. Suspecting a Separatist plot behind this irrationality, Anakin decides to have Tup brought back to Kamino for a more thorough check. Trench, who had also witnessed the clone's strange disorder, contacts Count Dooku. Dooku initially believes that the clone just simply betrayed the Jedi, but when Trench explains the clone's actions, Dooku becomes alarmed. He then contacts his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, concluding that Tup's behavior might prematurely reveal their true plans for the war, and the two Sith decide to kidnap the clone before the Republic can examine him.

The Republic prepares a Nu-class transport to bring Tup to Kamino, with Fives promising to have a drink with him once he returns. As the transport leaves the space station and prepares to make the jump to hyperspace, one of the pilots finds contact up ahead. A HMP droid gunship with five super battle droid rocket troopers ambush the convoy. The rocket troopers disable the escorting fighters, while the gunship fires a discord missile and the resulting buzz droids kill both pilots, but one of them manages to send a distress signal before he is killed. The clones guarding Tup soon realize they are under attack and grab their blasters to defend Tup. While one of the medical officers manages to take down two of the super battle droids, all of the clones are eventually killed. The remaining droids then free Tup from the medical table and place him into a container before departing back to Separatist space.

Upon investigating the shuttle's wreck, Skywalker, Rex and Fives swiftly notice Tup is missing and conclude that his strange malady is somehow of great interest to the Separatists. Following the signal from Tup's communicator, they sneak their way to the ring station's main hangar just as Tup is brought aboard a shuttle, but find it too heavily guarded to fight their way to the ship. Just before the shuttle leaves the hangar, however, Fives gets the bright idea to use grappling lines to catch a ride on the shuttle just as it leaves the hangar; the three thereupon board the ship, disable the droid crew and return to their own lines to prepare another transport to Kamino. Fives persuades Rex to allow him to accompany the transport, and the two depart with their stricken comrade for Kamino.
