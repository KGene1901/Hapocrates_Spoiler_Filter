Following the raid on the Separatist intelligence center on Anaxes, the clones return to Fort Anaxes. Rex informs Jedi General Anakin Skywalker that they will travel to the planet Skako Minor to find Echo, a missing Clone trooper who disappeared during a previous mission. The Clone Force 99 trooper Hunter recommends that they use his team's personal gunship, the Havoc Marauder. General Obi-Wan Kenobi criticizes Rex for embarking on a "reckless plan" but the Clone Commander managed to convince his superiors that they need to prevent the Separatists from having access to the algorithm. Unwilling to argue with them, Kenobi lets them go but warns them to be back before the next rotation.

Rex, Anakin, and Force 99 prepare to depart on the Havoc Marauder for Skako Minor. Skywalker notices that the ship has nose-art of his secret wife, the Naboo Senator Padm√© Amidala, whom the clones admire. Wrecker jokes about negotiating with Amidala anytime. Meanwhile on Skako Minor, Minister Wat Tambor is contacted by Admiral Trench, who warns him that an infiltration team of clones has traced the algorithm's signal to Skako Minor. Trench warns that a Republic attack is imminent and Tambor resolves to be ready.

In space, Skywalker, Rex and Force 99 prepare for their assault. Force 99 are reluctant to reveal who they answer to. Shortly later, they exit hyperspace above Skako Minor. Tech flies the ship into a storm but they manage to safely land on the planet's surface. Tech informs his fellow clones and Skywalker that they have landed on a part of Skako Minor that is inhabited by Poletec, a primitive people who worshiped large flying reptiles called Keeradaks. Shortly later, the Havoc Marauder is attacked by a keeradak.

Skywalker and the clones go out to confront the keeradak, which carries a Poletecan mount. The keeradak kidnaps Anakin with its claws and flies away. The clone trooper Crosshair manages to fire a grappling hook at the keeradak and attempts to shoot it down but his blaster is knocked out of his hand by one of the keeradaks. The keeradak tries to knock Crosshair against the rocks which causes Crosshair to lose his grip. Despite falling, Crosshair is unhurt and manages to track Skywalker and his kidnappers to a nearby Poletecan village. The villagers take Anakin prisoner.

Meanwhile, the clones join Crosshair at the edge of the village. After resolving not to terrorize the villagers, the clones move in to rescue Skywalker. They used a boulder to smash several structures and managed to awe the Poletecans by their display of firepower. In the end, the Poletecan chief ordered a ceasefire and told the clones that he did not want their war on his planet. The chief also explained that this was the reason he had kidnapped Skywalker. With Tech acting as a translator, Anakin told the Poletecans that Wat Tambor and his Separatists were responsible for bringing the war to Skako Minor. Rex then told Tech to tell the Poletecs that he and the Clones would apologize for their actions. He also explained that they were here to rescue one of their comrades, Echo, who had fallen into the hands of the Separatists. The chief provided the clones and Skywalker with scouts to lead them to Tambor's city Purkoll but no further.

During the journey, Tech found that he was unable to trace Echo's signal. Hunter thinks that the Separatists are trying to lure them into a trap. When Crosshair suggested that Echo had become a traitor, Rex assaulted him. Anakin managed to defuse the situation by sending Force 99 to scout out the surroundings while he talked to Rex. While Rex defended Echo, Anakin advised him that they should be ready for such a situation. Rex understands Anakin's concerns but insists on being the one to deal with his former comrade.

In Purkoll, Force 99 manages to trace Echo's signal to a tower. Shortly later, they are joined by Anakin and Rex. Tech managed to enter the facility and they took a lift to the top. While on the lift, Anakin reminded the clones that they were on a stealth mission and told them to avoid blowing things up. Upon exiting the lift, the clones found themselves facing several D-wing air support droids. The clones and Skywalker quickly dispatched the droids in a brief skirmish. Exploring the facility, they lose Echo's signal again. Tech theorizes that the signal is only visible during data transmissions and that they have to wait for Echo to transmit more data.
