Anakin orders the clones to split up while they search the facility. Skywalker heads into a chamber where he dispatches two D-wing droids tat attempt to trap him. Meanwhile, the clones search the chambers. Tech traces the signal to an upstairs chamber but finds that its entrance is sealed. Shortly later, they receive a hologram message from Wat Tambor who informs the clones that he was aware that they were coming and had laid a trap for them. He told them that he had use their algorithm to predict every movement they had made to infiltrate Skako Minor, thus violating the Techno Union's neutrality. Rex responds that Tambor had violated the Union's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner to Skako Minor. Before departing, Tambor praises the clones for playing their part and orders several D-wing droids to execute them.

The clones fight the D-wing droids and are assisted by Anakin, who helps them to destroy all the droids. After fighting off the droids, Tech manages to open the door to the chamber. Rex and Tech head into a large chamber where they find Echo confined within a stasis chamber. Echo has been drugged and is completely unaware of his surroundings. Several tubes have been fitted into him and some of his limbs have been replaced by prosthetic parts. Rex and Tech deduce that Echo had been kept unconscious by the Separatists who remotely mined his mind for information on the Republic's strategies on Anaxes. Rex comforts his old comrade and he and Tech begin freeing Echo.
