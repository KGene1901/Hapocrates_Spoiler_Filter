There are two important questions on reconstructing the production tree: why do we
need it; and how do we do it.
The requirement to recover the production tree is not natural. After all, a grammar
is a condensed description of a set of strings, i.e., a language, and our input string
either belongs or does not belong to that language; no internal structure or production
path is involved. If we adhere to this formal view, the only meaningful question we
can ask is if a given string can be recognized according to a grammar; any question
as to how would be a sign of senseless, even morbid curiosity. In practice, however,
grammars have semantics attached to them: specific semantics is attached to specific
rules, and in order to determine the semantics of a string we need to find out which
rules were involved in its production and how. In short, recognition is not enough,
and we need to recover the production tree to get the full benefit of the syntactic
approach.
