By these definitions, computing
qualifies as an exact science. It
studies information processes,
which occur naturally in the physical world; computer scientists work
with an accepted, systematized
body of knowledge; much computer science is applied; and computer science is used for prediction
and verification.
The objection that computing
is not a science because it studies
man-made objects (technologies)
is a red herring. Computer science studies information
processes both artificial and natural. It helps other fields study
theirs too. Physicists explain particle behavior with quantum
information processes—some of
which, like entanglement, are
quite strange—and verify their
theories with computer simulation experiments. Bioinformaticians explain DNA as encoded
biological information and study
how transcription enzymes read
and act on it; computer models
