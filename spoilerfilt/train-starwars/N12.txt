In his remarkable book about the
workings of science, Science in
Action, the philosopher Bruno
Latour brings a note of caution to
the distinction between science
and art [7]. Everything discussed
in this column (a systematized
body of knowledge, ability to
make predictions, validation of
models), is part of what he calls
ready-made-science, science that is
ready to be used and applied, science that is ready to support art.
Much science-in-the-making
appears as art until it becomes settled science.
Latour defines science-in-themaking as the processes by which
scientific facts are proposed,
argued, and accepted. A new
proposition is argued and studied
in publications, conferences, letters, email correspondence, discussions, debates, practice, and
repeated experiments. It becomes
a “fact” only after it wins many
allies among scientists and others
using it. To win allies, a proposition must be independently verified by multiple observations and
there must be no counterexamples. Latour sees science-in-themaking as a messy, political,
human process, fraught with emotion and occasional polemics. The
scientific literature bears him out.
Everything Latour says is consistent with the time-honored definition of the science paradigm. After
sufficient time and validation, a
model becomes part of the scientific body of knowledge.
