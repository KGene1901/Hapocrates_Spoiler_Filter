Before continuing, we must stress that that there is
opposition to constructivism.2 The criticism is not
so much of. the constructivist theory of learning, but
rather of extreme conclusions drawn from constructivist epistemology. Carried to the extreme, radical constructivism leads t,o solipsism, the philosophical claim
that the world is my own creation or dream. In turn,
this can lead to a rejection of ethics: if the world is
my own creation, why should I care what happens to
others? Carried to the extreme, social constructivism
leads to a view of science as a merely political enterprise developed by entrenched elitist groups whose
main purpose is to ensure their own survival. From
the fallibility of scientific knowledge, one slips into
relativism of truth, and from the sociology of scientific
practice, into demands for empowerment detached
from any attempt at objective evaluation of scientific
knowledge.
