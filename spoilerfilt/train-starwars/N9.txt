Graphical user interfaces (GUI) are often touted as
‘intuitive’ and ‘user-friendly’, yet many new users are
anxiety-ridden. From a constructivist point of view,
this paradox is easily resolved. An icon is just a
representation; it is useful only to the extent that the
user -can ‘construct a mental model of object being
represented.
Consider the icon for a ‘running man’. This represents
the action that ‘iauses the computer to perform the
machine instructions that are obtained by compiling
the source code’. Jargon calls this ‘running a program’.
The icon is thus two steps removed from the action:
first, the icon must be deciphered as representing the
word ‘,‘running’ rather than ‘chasing’ or ‘racing’, and
then this word must be related to a mental model of
the computer.
Icons are intuitive to the extent that the analogy between the object shown and the object represented is
perfect. But as Glynn shows [6], analogies are rarely,
if ever, perfect, so one ‘must not lose patience with a
novice who has yet to construct an efficient model of
the underlying machine.
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) is
another concept’ that could benefit from some constructivist analysis. Opponents of WYSIWYG often
paraphrase, it sarcastically as ‘what you see is all you
get’, but this misses the point.,
