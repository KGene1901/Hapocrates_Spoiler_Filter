This is probably the most effective use of Zack Snyder's particular style: dark backgrounds, sharp colors, slow-mo action, random splurts of blood, and a general dread pervading every scene: the world of Superheroes is on the precipice of annihilation.

Even if you've seen this before, it's a remarkably engrossing movie -- probably thanks to its amazing cast: Jackie Earle Haley sinks into the growling, unflappable detective Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan smiles a big toothy smile while the psycho Comedian guns down Vietnamese soldiers, and Billy Crudup conveys a world of hope and hurt through Dr. Manhattan's monotone voice and slight facial tics (often enough to make you ignore his definitely visible blue dingdong).

It's a movie that takes its time, introduces its heroes and makes their moral compasses crystal clear. We come to understand, and even sympathize, with all of their point-of-views that have grown gnarled, jaded, and subdued under the specter of the Cold War. And it quickly becomes apparent that the movie isn't really about the mystery of who killed the Comedian. It's really about a much deeper, simpler, and aggravatingly unclear question at the heart of Supehero mythos: is humanity even worth saving?

And I admire that the movie refuses to answer.
