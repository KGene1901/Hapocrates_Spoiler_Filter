Despite the seemingly restrictive
subtitle of this book, Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer
Science, is first and foremost a most
approachable book on mathematics:
mathematics pure and simple, mathematics theoretical and applied, mathematics combinatorial and algorithmic,
mathematics discrete and continuous.
It is also the kind of book on mathematics many physicists will enjoy reading
and be rewarded by the experience.
Concrete Mathematics is an enlightening, serious college-level textbook treating several topics in detail, by
way of lucid, well-structured exposition, providing further guidance in the
form of extensive exercises (complete
with answers) and an occasional research problem. The two senior coauthors (Graham and Knuth) are
mathematicians of international renown and respected scholars widely
known to the general public and the
computer science community through
their earlier popular works.
